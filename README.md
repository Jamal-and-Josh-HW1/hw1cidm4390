This is a simple program to check who is registered with the Code Club. All front end is done by Joshua Tarrant
and the backend was completed by Jamal Al-Sarraf. We are working with Github and learning to branch slowsly but surely.
If there are any questions please feel free to ask us about it. The initial commit was done by Jamal and the rest was done
by Josh.
